    What Is Whiskey?

    The world of whiskey is a complex maze of grains, flavors, and
    distillation processes. It is one of the most diverse distilled
    spirits in the bar. In order to fully understand exactly what
    whiskey is, we need to look at each individual style.

    Understanding What Makes Whiskey

    Essentially, all whiskeys are distilled from malted grains such as
    barley, corn, rye, wheat, etc. Whiskey is also almost always (with
    the exception of moonshine or white dog) aged in barrels for
    anywhere from just a few years to decades.

    Four countries produce distinctly different whiskeys: Ireland (Irish
    whiskey), Scotland (Scotch whiskey), America (bourbon, Tennessee
    whiskey, rye whiskey, blended American whiskey), and Canada
    (Canadian whiskey). However, whiskey is made throughout the world. A
    number of countries, including Japan, are beginning to make a name
    for themselves in the whiskey industry as well.

    This wide market ensures that almost everyone will find a brand or
    style that they prefer. When asked, every whiskey connoisseur has a
    pointed opinion on which is the best whiskey.

    Let's explore this diverse liquor in its entirety. We'll look at the
    basic characteristics of each style of whiskey and how they differ
    from one another.

    Irish Whiskey: the Father of Them All

    Considered to be the father of all whiskey, all Irish whiskey must
    be produced in Ireland. It is often a blend of pot-stilled malted
    and unmalted whiskeys with column-stilled, corn-based grain whiskey.
    Then again, as in the case of Bushmills, it may also be triple
    distilled malted barley (a single malt).

    This complex blend and the fact that Irish whiskey malt is dried in
    a closed kiln away from fire and smoke, distinguish it from scotch,
    its closest whiskey cousin. Great care is taken during distillation
    to keep the temperature low so as not to break the delicately sweet,
    toasty, honey flavor.

    Quite often, Irish whiskey is aged in used bourbon barrels or
    various wine casks for at least three years. As with all whiskey, it
    can be aged for longer periods and this affects the smoothness as
    well as the price.

    Irish Whiskey Brands and Cocktails

    The selection of Irish whiskey brands that are available is smaller
    than most of the other styles. However, the list does include some
    of the big names in the whiskey business, including Bushmills,
    Jameson, and Tullamore D.E.W. Yet, you'll also find some hidden gems
    in the Irish whiskey lineup and will want to look out for labels
    like Connemara, Greenore, and Slieve Foy.

    As far as cocktailsgo, Irish whiskey is extremely versatile. There
    are, of course, favorites like the Irish coffee and shooters such as
    the Irish car bomb. Yet, it also works wonders in simple, refreshing
    drinks like the whiskey and ginger and Irish tea party.

    Scotch Whisky: the Iconic Single Malts and Blends

    By tradition and standard, Scotch whiskey uses the spelling for
    whiskey without the "e" and it can only be made in Scotland. The
    distinct smoky flavor found in this whiskey is due to the malt
    drying process. Part of this is done over a peat-fueled fire that
    allows the smoke to come in direct contact with the malt.

    Although the smoky aspect defines scotch, each region of Scotland
    produces different and distinct flavor characteristics. This is
    particularly evident in single malts.

    When choosing a scotch. you will find either "single malt" or
    "blended" on the label along with an age statement. In the case of
    blended, the age is that of the youngest whiskey in the blend.

    Single Malt Scotch Whisky

    Single malt scotch is produced by a single distillery. There are
    around 100 distilleries in Scotland that make single malt whiskey
    and each has its own distinct flavor characteristics and
    notes. Single malts tend to have more flavor than blended scotch and
    are used to create those blends.

    After distilling the malted barley twice in pot stills, a 140 proof
    spirit called "plain British spirit" is pumped into oak casks and is
    aged for at least three years. A number of single malts can be aged
    for 20 or 30 years. 

    It's customary to enjoy single malts on their own or on the rocks,
    though some cocktails do call for a single malt scotch. Some of the
    brands to look for include The Glenlivet, Glen Scotia, Laphroaig,
    and The Macallan. Within this category are some of the most
    expensive whiskeys in the world, though each brand typically offers
    labels that are affordable as well.

    Blended Scotch Whisky

    The majority of scotch sold is blended and it is preferred for
    scotch cocktails. They tend to be more mixable with a variety of
    ingredients and are often sold at a more reasonable price than the
    single malts.

    The harder flavors of single malts are softened by blending them
    with grain whiskeys in a cask for several months after each has been
    aged separately. Scotch blends are an art and each scotch house has
    its own secret recipe and master blender.

    While the exact blends are often unknown and very unique, it is not
    uncommon for 20 to 25 whiskeys to be used in a blend with around 20
    to 50 percent of those comprised of single malt whiskeys. The
    higher-end blended Scotches will include more single malts, which
    leads to a deeper flavor.

    When it comes to blended scotch, there is a great diversity among
    the brands. Some of the best-known include The Black Grouse, Chivas
    Regal, Dewars, and Johnnie Walker. You will not find it difficult to
    discover blended scotches at every price point, from around $20 to
    upwards of a few hundred.

    Bourbon Whiskey: America's Native Spirit

    When one thinks of bourbon whiskey, Kentucky, the mint julep, and
    the old-fashioned immediately come to mind. While bourbon whiskey
    received its name from Bourbon County, Kentucky, no bourbon is made
    there today. Yet, bourbon can be distilled in any state of the U.S.
    Technically, bourbon cannot be produced in other countries.

    According to a 1964 act of Congress, bourbon must have a mash
    bill of at least 51 percent corn, with other grain whiskeys
    comprising the remainder. This straight whiskey, known as "America's
    Native Spirit," must be distilled at 160 proof (80 percent ABV) or
    less. It is often bottled between 80 and 120 proof.

    Bourbon must also be aged a minimum of two years in new, charred oak
    barrels, although it is often aged for four years or more. Bourbon
    barrels can only be used once, so they are often used by other
    liquor producers after the first use. It's very common to have
    tequilas, rums, and other whiskeys aged in used bourbon barrels.

    No blending or additives—except water to reduce it to bottling
    proof—is allowed in bourbon.

    Bourbon Cocktails and Brands

    Bourbon is one of the preferred whiskeys for mixed drinks. In fact,
    many of the most popular whiskey cocktails call for it. It is a very
    versatile whiskey and mixes well in everything from a Manhattan to a
    John Collins. Quite often, when a cocktail recipe calls for
    "whiskey," a good bourbon will do just fine.

    You will have no difficulty finding great bourbon for drinking
    straight or mixing into cocktails. This is a great style for
    diversity and includes the biggest names in the whiskey industry.
    Look for names like Maker's Mark, Woodford Reserve, and Wild Turkey.
    Also, there's the entire Jim Beam portfolio, which includes
    small-batch favorites like Knob Creek and Basil Hayden's.

    In America's growing craft distillery scene, bourbon is a favorite.
    Check out the distilleries in your area because some of the best
    whiskeys produced today come from the smallest operations.

    Tennessee Whiskey: the Charcoal Filter

    Tennessee sour mash whiskey is very similar to bourbon. It also only
    requires a distillate of at least 51 percent corn, with a maximum of
    79 percent.

    The distinct difference in Tennessee whiskey is due to a unique
    filtration process in which the whiskey is allowed to slowly drip
    through 10 feet of sugar maple charcoal. Known as the "Lincoln
    County Process," it can take up to two weeks to run one batch
    through the charcoal.

    The whiskey is then transferred to a charred barrel for aging for a
    minimum of two years. It is common to pick up a charcoal taste in
    Tennessee whiskey, most prominently in the two dominant brands, Jack
    Daniels and George Dickel.

    Tennessee Whiskey Cocktails and Beyond

    Mixing with Tennessee whiskey is much like making drinks with
    bourbon. In fact, many drinkers interchange the two in recipes. Yet,
    due to the fame of Jack Daniels, there are a couple of drinks that
    are icons of this style and that brand, in particular.

    The Jack and Coke is the easiest of them all. It is really nothing
    more than topping a shot of Jack Daniels with Coca-Cola in a
    highball glass filled with ice. The other is the famous Lynchburg
    lemonade, a refreshing cocktail that mimics a spiked, sparkling
    lemonade with triple sec and lemon juice.

    The distinct flavor of Jack Daniels is also a favorite for home
    chefs. From barbecue sauces to marinades and glazes, it can really
    add a nice touch to certain foods, particularly meats.

    Rye Whiskey: a Natural Spice

    Wheat and barley are commonly used to make rye whiskey. However,
    U.S. law mandates that at least 51 percent of the grain used is rye.
    Rye whiskey is typically produced in the U.S. and Canada. It is one
    of the whiskeys that is often included in the blends of Canadian
    whiskey.

    Rye whiskey is most similar in taste to bourbon. There is a notable
    spiciness and slightly bitter flavor to it that is due to the
    natural flavors of rye. It makes for the most interesting whiskey
    that is distinct from all the other styles.

    The Resurgence of Rye

    Rye whiskey was very popular during Colonial times, especially in
    the Northeast. However, Prohibition damaged the industry and only a
    few distilleries continued production after it was repealed. 

    Rye has made a comeback in recent years and this popularity
    coincided with a renewed interest in classic cocktails, which called
    for it on a regular basis. Drinks like the Manhattan, for instance,
    originally called for rye. During the "drought" of rye, however, it
    became customary to pour a bourbon or Canadian whiskey instead.
    Likewise, if you're looking for an authentic Vieux Carre or Waldorf
    cocktail, you'll want to pick up a bottle of rye.

    There are a number of new brands of rye whiskey that are following
    this trend, as well as a few old favorites that stuck around through
    the hard times. Alberta Dark Batch, High West, Old Overholt,
    Rittenhouse, Sazerac, and WhistlePig are just a few of the brands to
    look for in this category. Some bourbon brands, including Knob Creek
    and Jim Beam, also offer a rye whiskey.

    Canadian Whisky: Masters of Blending

    When a cocktail calls for "whiskey" without suggesting a specific
    style, you may want to choose a good Canadian whiskey. It is
    light-bodied, versatile, and very mixable. Most of the time,
    Canadian whisky also skips the "e" in whiskey, following in the
    Scotch tradition.

    Canadian whisky can only be produced in Canada. It is made primarily
    of corn or wheat and supplemented with rye, barley, or barley malt.
    It is aged in used oak barrels for a minimum of three years,
    although most are aged for four to six years.

    Almost all Canadian Whiskey is a blend of various grain whiskeys of
    different ages. It is a complicated process that requires a master
    blender to create the smooth Canadian whiskeys that we taste in the
    bottle. Canadian distillers are known for their blending skills and
    can rival that of the best scotch blenders.

    Canadian Whisky Cocktails and Brands

    There is no shortage of Canadianwhiskeysavailable on the shelves of
    liquor stores. Canadian Club, Canadian Mist, Caribou Crossing, Crown
    Royal, and Forty Creek are just a few worth tasting. You'll also be
    happy to know that brands in this style tend to be among the most
    affordable whiskeys on the market.

    When it comes to cocktails, nearly any drink that uses whiskey is a
    good candidate for a pour of a smooth Canadian. It can work in
    modern as well as classic cocktails, with fruits, in sweet drinks,
    and tall, refreshing highballs. When we say a Canadian blend is
    versatile, we really do mean it.

    A recipe such as the Canadian cocktail is a perfect introduction to
    the style's mixability and it's similar to the Canadian Club sour.
    For something that's fun and unique, try the mango iced tea recipe
    with a 12-year-old whiskey.

    American Blended and Straight Whiskey: Smooth and Mixable

    Like blended scotch, American blended whiskey is a careful selection
    of straight whiskeys and grain spirits combined to create one
    distinct spirit. This is another good whiskey option for cocktail
    recipes that don't specify a style.

    A blended whiskey must contain at least 20 percent straight whiskey.
    Premium brands may include as many as 75 different straight whiskeys
    and grain neutral spirits. This art of blending produces a balanced,
    rich, light-bodied whiskey, each with its own character.

    The brands are too numerous to list and often include American-made
    whiskeys that do not fall into the rye or bourbon styles. That's
    because the brand's production doesn't prescribe to the labeling
    requirements of either of those for one reason or another.

    There are a number of "straight" American whiskeys available as
    well. This means that they are not blended, but go straight from the
    still to the barrel. We're seeing much more of these thanks to the
    craft distillery movement in the U.S.

    Other Whiskies of the World: a Burgeoning Scene

    Japan, Taiwan, Australia, New Zealand, England, and even India and
    South Africa are becoming more widely known for making some
    impressive whiskeys. Many of these either have no set regulations to
    designate styles or they are very specific to the country.

    It is very interesting that many of these worldly whiskeys are
    single malts. Japanese whisky producers are specialists in creating
    brilliant single malts and they are often compared to scotch in
    taste, style, and quality.

    As more whiskey is produced in countries not typically known for
    doing so, it will be interesting to see what happens. It is
    certainly something for whiskey connoisseurs to be excited about
    because it gives us new expressions to explore.

    For the most part, these whiskeys are versatile. Try a new bottle
    out in your favorite cocktails and see how it works. This is
    a category that is completely open for experimentation for the
    simple fact that it's relatively new.

    Flavored Whiskey: Fruity and Spiced Elixirs

    Whiskey is also a fantastic base liquor to add flavor to. It is not
    as common as flavored vodkas or rums, but flavored whiskeys are
    around and are rather useful and fun. There are a handful of
    cocktails that call for flavored whiskey of some sort and they are
    quite delicious.

    Traditional Apple Whiskey

    Apple whiskey was a rather popular ingredient in classic cocktails
    and it was quite popular in the days before Prohibition. There are a
    few brands—primarily small distilleries—that continue to produce
    true apple whiskey. The New York-based Leopold Bros. is certainly
    one to check out.

    New Flavored Whiskies

    As infused distilled spirits become more popular, a number of
    distillers are venturing into this realm with their whiskeys and the
    options continue to grow. Flavored whiskey (like vodka) can be
    tricky, though. Some producers use unnatural ingredients to flavor
    the whiskey while others prefer a clean, true flavor from natural
    ingredients.

    Most flavored "whiskeys" are technically liqueurs because of the
    sweeteners and flavoring ingredients used. In the case of bourbon,
    it cannot technically be labeled "bourbon" after _any_ flavoring is
    added (even without sweeteners). It is instead deemed "whiskey"
    though sometimes you'll see something to the effect of "bourbon
    liqueur" on the label.

    DIY Flavored Whiskey

    Making your own flavored whiskey is just as easy as any other
    infusion. All you need is a bottle of whiskey, the flavoring
    ingredient, and a little time. It's quite fun and, given the
    different flavor profiles available in whiskey, the possibilities
    are endless.
