<li>Soft towels</li>
</ul>
<p>To start off, make sure the fryer is completely off and pour oil inside to completely cool down.</p>

<p>With a scraper, scrape contents that managed to build up on the sides of the fryer. Make sure to dispose these substances.</p>
<p>Next is where the boil out process begins. You have to fill up the fryer with water.Make sure to fill it up with the same amount as you would with oil.</p>
<p>Pour a little amount of grease-dissolving dish detergent into the water you poured into the fryer and move it around a little to mix the two substances together.</p>
<p>Turn on the fryer so the water inside can begin to boil.Let the water and soap you put in the fryer boil for a while as this will help in loosening and removing the stubborn oil found on the sides.</p>
<p>After several minutes, shut down the fryer and let the liquid inside cool down.Once it’s cool enough, properly dispose the water and wipe the insides with a paper towel or a sponge.</p>
<p>Try your best to remove as much oil as you possibly can from the sides of the fryer.</p>
<p>Next, fill up a bowl with water and add dish detergent. With this mixture, you can moisten the scrubber you’ll use to scrub away any stubborn remaining oil found within the fryer.</p>

<p>Use this paste to rub on the fryer surface where you find any oil remnants.With a sponge or any cloth, rub this paste into a circular motion and continue doing so until the remnants are removed.</p>
<p>After that, rinse the fryer again with water. Make sure that the fryer is clear of any cleaning products before wiping it dry with a towel.Make sure that all areas of the fryer are dry before using the appliance again.</p>
