# Resignation as Trustee

It is with some regret that I am writing you today. I,
_Craig Carley_, do on Saturday January 25th, 2020 resign
from my role as Trustee of *Lake Eagles #3761*. I hereby
relinquish all rights and benefits related to this 
role and consider all my duties discharged as of this
notification.

## Consequences

- I will not be available for daily accounting and 
bookkeeping prior to opening.

- As there is no _kitchen manager_ at *#3761*, I will 
continue to take care of weekly orders until Sandy 
receives her certification.

- I will continue in my role as bartender as needed
and by agreement. However, if the propane tanks are
not returned to the porch by Monday morning, I am 
locking the club, filing a police report, and never
returning. Hey, I don't want to be a dick, but DV 
started this bullshit.

## Precipitating Events

It is my belief that the recent decisions taken by
*#3761 BOT* have demonstrated poor judgment and made
for less than virtuous reasons. The issue involves a
$10.00 payout for propane. DV discovered the payout
but rather than calling me (the one who made the payout),
DV called around the neighborhood stirring up trouble
in a clumsy attempt to make the new guy look bad. Problems
are rarely solved by this strategy. This is not the 
first time I have noticed such passive-aggressive
behavior and ill-conceived attempts of manipulation.
This is not the way to build a community of happy patrons 
and staff that work as a team. 

The subsequent actions were impulsive, reckless and 
not in the best interests of *#3761*. Rather 
than breeding cooperation and good will, this behavior 
is destroying our club and I cannot be party to such 
foolishness and stupidity.
