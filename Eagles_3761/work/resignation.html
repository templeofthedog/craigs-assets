<h1 id="resignation-as-trustee">Resignation as Trustee</h1>
<p>It is with some regret that I am writing you today. I, <em>Craig Carley</em>, do on Saturday January 25th, 2020 resign from my role as Trustee of <em>Lake Eagles #3761</em>. I hereby relinquish all rights and benefits related to this role and consider all my duties discharged as of this notification.</p>
<h2 id="consequences">Consequences</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>I will not be available for daily accounting and bookkeeping prior to opening.</p></li>
<li><p>As there is no <em>kitchen manager</em> at <em>#3761</em>, I will continue to take care of weekly orders until Sandy receives her certification.</p></li>
<li><p>I will continue in my role as bartender as needed and by agreement. However, if the propane tanks are not returned to the porch by Monday morning, I am locking the club, filing a police report, and never returning. Hey, I don't want to be a dick, but DV started this bullshit.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="precipitating-events">Precipitating Events</h2>
<p>It is my belief that the recent decisions taken by <em>#3761 BOT</em> have demonstrated poor judgment and made for less than virtuous reasons. The issue involves a $10.00 payout for propane. DV discovered the payout but rather than calling me (the one who made the payout), DV called around the neighborhood stirring up trouble in a clumbsy attempt to make the new guy look bad. Problems are rarely solved by this strategy. This is not the first time I have noticed such passive-aggressive behavior and ill-conceived attempts of manipulation. This is not the way to build a community of happy patrons and staff that work as a team.</p>
<p>The subsequent actions were impulsive, reckless and not in the best interests of <em>#3761</em>. Rather than breeding cooperation and good will, this behavior is destroying our club and I cannot be party to such foolishness and stupidity.</p>
