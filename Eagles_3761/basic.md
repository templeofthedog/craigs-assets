LIQUOR 101 - THE 6 TYPES OF DISTILLED SPIRITS


Brandy, Gin, Rum, Tequila, Vodka, and Whiskey

By Colleen Graham


There are many distilled spirits available today, though there are just
six base liquors that form the foundation of the majority of cocktails
and liqueurs. Brandy, gin, rum, tequila, vodka, and whiskey are each
unique and have distinct styles within themselves.

Learn the basic characteristics of each of these liquors to give you an
understanding of what makes each special and how to use them in drinks.

    Brandy

    -   DISTILLED FROM_:_ Fruit. Primarily grapes, though apple,
        apricot, cherry, peach, and other fruits are also used.
    -   FLAVOR PROFILE_:_ Fruity burnt wine.
    -   AGED_:_ Typically aged in oak, varies by style. Often blended.
    -   PRODUCED IN_:_ Worldwide. Certain regions of the world produce
        specific styles of brandy such as Cognac and Armagnac.
    -   STYLES: Cognac, Armagnac, Spanish Brandy, Pisco, American
        Brandy, Grappa, Eau-de-vie, Flavored Brandies
    -   ALCOHOL CONTENT: Typically 40 percent alcohol/volume (80 proof)
    -   REGULATIONS: No distinct worldwide regulations. Some of the
        styles _must_ be produced in certain regions. There is also a
        system for indicating the age of brandies.
    -   COCKTAIL PROFILE: Brandy was used in a number of classic
        cocktails and tends to be used in more sophisticated drinks that
        include just a few ingredients. Many modern brandy recipes are
        breaking this mold, however, and experimenting with brandy in
        some very unique flavor combinations.


    Gin

    -   DISTILLED FROM: Neutral grains such as barley, corn, rye, and
        wheat. Flavored with a variety of botanicals, which vary by
        brand.
    -   FLAVOR PROFILE: Herbal, dry. The primary flavor that defines gin
        comes from juniper berries, thus the 'piney' aroma and taste.
    -   AGED: Typically unaged.
    -   PRODUCED IN: Worldwide
    -   STYLES: London Dry Gin, Plymouth Gin, Old Tom Gin, Genever, New
        American Gin
    -   ALCOHOL CONTENT: Typically 40 to 47 percent alcohol/volume (80
        to 94 proof)
    -   REGULATIONS: No distinct worldwide regulations. Juniper is the
        'accepted' defining quality.
    -   COCKTAIL PROFILE: Gin's dry profile makes it a perfect candidate
        for dry (non-sweet) cocktails, including many classics and
        martinis. It is a nice base for cocktails with just a few
        ingredients and pairs well with some of the lighter fruits and,
        naturally, works well with herbs.

    Rum

    -   DISTILLED FROM: Sugar. Either molasses or pure sugar cane.
    -   FLAVOR PROFILE: Sweet. Toasted sugar. Varies by style and
        region.
    -   AGED: Light rum is typically un-aged and other rums are often
        aged in oak barrels to some extent. Due to climate, aging times
        vary greatly with warm climate rum requiring less barrel time
        than those in colder climates. Often blended.
    -   PRODUCED IN: Worldwide
    -   STYLES: Light Rum, Gold Rum, Dark Rum, Over-Proof Rum, Spiced
        Rum, Cachaca, Flavored Rum
    -   ALCOHOL CONTENT: Typically 40 percent alcohol/volume (80 proof).
        Overproof rums can reach 75 percent alcohol/volume (150 proof).
    -   REGULATIONS: No distinct worldwide regulations. Some regional
        laws and traditions; an example is that cachaca must be produced
        in Brazil.
    -   COCKTAIL PROFILE: __ Rum's sweeter flavor makes it one of the
        more versatile spirits. It was one of the first liquors to be
        mixed into drinks, so there are some nice classic rum cocktails
        to choose from. It is the obvious base for tropical drinks. On
        the other side of the spectrum, it also appears in a number of
        warm cocktails.
    
    Tequila

    -   DISTILLED FROM: Agave
    -   FLAVOR PROFILE: Vegetal, earthy with semi-sweet and spicy tones.
    -   AGED: Blanco tequila is un-aged. Other tequilas are aged, often
        in used whiskey (bourbon) oak barrels. Gold tequila is blended.
    -   PRODUCED IN: Mexico. Agave spirits produced outside of Mexico
        _cannot_ be labeled 'tequila.'
    -   STYLES: Blanco, Reposado, Anejo, Extra-Anejo, Gold (Other agave
        spirits are mezcal, pulque, sotol, raicila, and baconara, but
        these are not _tequilas_.)
    -   ALCOHOL CONTENT: Typically 40 to 50 percent alcohol/volume (80
        to 100 proof).
    -   REGULATIONS: Tightly regulated by the Tequila Regulatory Council
        (CRT) under the Appellation of Origin, first adapted in 1978.
    -   COCKTAIL PROFILE: Tequila has a great flavor profile for mixing
        into a variety of cocktails. There are, of course, the
        margaritas and frozen cocktails in which tequila is mixed with
        any fruit imaginable. It also makes a perfect base for spicy
        cocktails and is very popular for party shots.

    Vodka

    -   DISTILLED FROM: Neutral grain (rye, corn, wheat, etc.) or
        potato. Some are distilled from beets, grapes, and other bases.
        Vodka can be the 'catch-all' category for white spirits that fit
        nowhere else.
    -   FLAVOR PROFILE: Neutral alcohol/ethanol. Varies greatly
        depending on the base and added flavorings. Distinguished more
        by texture: oily vs. medicinal.
    -   AGED: Typically un-aged.
    -   PRODUCED IN: Worldwide
    -   STYLES: Clear vodka is typically distinguished by the base it
        was distilled from and/or the region it was produced. Flavored
        vodkas are a popular category.
    -   ALCOHOL CONTENT: Typically 40 to 50 percent alcohol/volume (80
        to 100 proof).
    -   REGULATIONS: No distinct worldwide regulations.
    -   COCKTAIL PROFILE: Vodka's neutral taste makes it the most
        versatile spirit available today. Vodka cocktails can be found
        on almost every imaginable flavor profile from sweet to savory,
        fruits to herbs and spices. Martinis and shooters are popular
        vodka drinks as well.
    
    Whiskey

    -   DISTILLED FROM: Malted grains which vary by style. Can include a
        mixture of corn, rye, wheat, barley, etc.
    -   FLAVOR PROFILE: Roasted, malted grain with oak undertones. There
        are distinct characteristics in each style.
    -   AGED: Typically aged in charred oak. Some styles, such as
        bourbon, require new barrels while others use a mixture of new
        and previously used whiskey or wine barrels. Moonshine is the
        primary exception to aging. Some whiskeys are blended while
        others are single malt or _straight_.
    -   PRODUCED IN: Worldwide
    -   STYLES: __ Irish Whiskey, Scotch, Bourbon, Rye Whiskey,
        Tennessee Whiskey, Canadian Whisky, Blended Whiskey, Flavored
        Whiskey, other emerging styles based on location (e.g., Japanese
        Whisky)
    -   ALCOHOL CONTENT: Typically 40 to 50 percent alcohol/volume (80
        to 100 proof). Some are higher.
    -   REGULATIONS: Most styles have their own distinct regulations
        governed by the country of origin. Some, such as those labeled
        'blended whiskey' alone, is not prone to tight regulations (that
        is not to say they are _not_ regulated).
    -   COCKTAIL PROFILE: Whiskey is another of the more versatile
        cocktail bases available and with so many styles, there is the
        opportunity for great diversity in flavor profiles. It mixes
        well with other liquors to create complex drinks and it pairs
        well with a number of fruits, particularly the darker fruits.
        Warm drinks are also very popular with whiskey.
